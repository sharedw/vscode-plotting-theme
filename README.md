# VSCode-plotting-theme
This code edits the style of your Matplotlib and Seaborn plots so that they match the style of your VSCode theme. I like working with dark themes, and got tired of having bright white plots yelling at me any time that I plotted something in my VSCode Notebook. This works on Windows for custom themes, and most of the built-in themes. All you need to do is add 'import set_theme' to the top of your notebook. 
Here's some of examples of before and after, with different themes.

Monokai Dimmed:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;">

Feel free to submit PRs if any Linux/Mac users out there want to adjust this so that it works for their OS. All you'll need to do is adjust where the 'set_theme' file is looking for the extension folders.
